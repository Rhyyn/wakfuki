# WakfuKi , une encyclop√©die pour Wakfu 

Tech stack : React / NextJS, IndexedDB using DexieJS, SCSS

### WIP
The project is currently WIP, I started working on this specific project in early December 2023, before I could start writing any code for the website, I had to write an entire Web Scraper using Python (https://github.com/Rhyyn/WakfuWebScraper), this was necessary in order to fill the blanks in the data provided by the Game's studio.

It also includes formatting by reconstructing objects based on the original data and the newly acquired data via CLI prompts. 

As of 08.02.2024 for the Wakfuki's website itself, it has working filters for both desktop and mobile, all the main tables for the Indexed DB are set up and ready to use, most of the front-end work is done.

What it lacks is: 
- The support for recipes if an item is can be crafted 
- Mounts/Pets/Emblems/Sublimations querying.
- CDN Setup for Item's images

This project currently has no back end, but will do for V2, which should hopefully include a Character builder as well as Auth for saving/sharing builds.
